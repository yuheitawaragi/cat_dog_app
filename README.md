# 🐶🐱 Dog & Cat Breed Classification Web App
This repository contains a web application that classifies dog and cat breeds from uploaded images using a deep learning model, and generates a short Japanese description of the predicted breed using a Large Language Model (LLM).  The application is built with Flask, PyTorch, and EfficientNet, and integrates an LLM via Ollama (Qwen2.5) for natural language generation.
